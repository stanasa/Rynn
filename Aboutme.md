It was a hot, late September night in Washington, D.C., when I first remembered about the Conduit. The memory was triggered by the smell of a particularly scented set of white roses that my fiancee had brought home from Trader Joe's: At night, I would lay down under the starched sheets and heavy comforters at my grandmother's old house. The heavy blankets would make me feel cocooned and protected. I would then close my eyes and, after a brief delay, see it. 

The Conduit was a silvery tunnel about twice as tall as I was, heading straight off into the distance. I always started inside the tunnel. There was no obvious source of light, but it was clear and well lit. The walls made a hollow, tinny sound when hit. At intervals, side tunnels would branch off at right angles. I only had to follow a branch for a few steps before I would invariably come across a gate with intricate floral patterns wrought in black iron. Peering through the gate would reveal a dreamscape. If I liked the dream, I would push open the gate and walk in, otherwise I'd trace my steps back to the main tunnel and look for another dream I liked better. 

Between the many cups of coffee per day, the incessant high-alert level at the start-up I worked for, and a thousand other things, sleep had not been coming easily to me those days. So I indulged the memory. I could not immediately remember when I'd stopped seeing the conduit, but it would be a fun exercise to do that night, in place of my usual yogic-inspired mind-wipe. So I tried it. Nothing. Tried the first few steps of my yogic exercise, and decided to give it another try. My mind refused to cooperate: with my eyes closed I could see only the barest outlines of silver. Finally, on the third try, armed with chamomile tea, fully half of my mind-clearing exercise, and my most comfortable blanket, I saw it. The first dream-branch had my work colleague Tom talking nonsense at a loud volume about CouchDB read/writes, IOPS and cloud provisioning. I left that door firmly closed. The next dream over had a grove of redwood trees. I slept like a baby and woke up the next morning more refreshed than I'd felt in months.
