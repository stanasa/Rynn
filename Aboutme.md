# The Lady in the Orange Dress

It was a hot, late September night in Washington, D.C., when I first remembered about the Conduit. The memory was, of course, triggered by the smell of a particularly scented set of white roses that my fiancee had brought home from Trader Joe's.

The memory, I thought, took me back to many years before. At night, I would lay down under the starched sheets and heavy comforters at my grandmother's old house. The heavy blankets would make me feel cocooned and protected. I would then close my eyes and, after a brief delay, see the Conduit. 

The Conduit was a silvery tunnel about twice as tall as I was, going straight off into the distance. There was no obvious source of light, but it was clear and well lit. At intervals, side tunnels would branch off at right angles. I could follow the branch a little bit and invariably come across a black wrought-iron gate. The black iron leaves and the black iron flowers of the gate were remarkably similar to my grandmother's set of East-German playing cards. But that won't become relevant until later. More importantly, I could peer through the gate, into a dreamscape. If I liked the dream, I would push open the gate and walk in, otherwise I'd trace my steps back to the conduit and look for another dream I liked better. 

Between the N cups of coffee per day, the incessant high-alert level at the start-up (yeah, I know, a start-up in D.C., crazy right?), and a thousand other things, sleep had not been coming easily to me those days. So I indulged the memory. I could not immediately remember when I'd stopped seeing the conduit, but it would be a fun exercise to do that night, in place of my usual yogic-inspired mindwipe. So I tried it. The conduit tunnel did not reveal itself that night, despite my best attempts to visualize it. Nor was I able to see it the following night. Finally, on the third night, armed with chamomile tea, fully half of my mind-clearing exercise, and my most comfortable blanket, I saw it. The first dream-branch had my work colleague Tom talking nonsense at a loud volume about CouchDB read/writes, IOPS and cloud provisioning. I left that door firmly closed. The next dream over had a grove of redwood trees. I slept like a baby and woke up the next morning more refreshed than I'd felt in months.

The only strange thing about it was the odd chill coming from somewhere far ahead in the conduit.
