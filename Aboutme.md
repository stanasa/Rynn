# The Lady in the Orange Dress

It was a hot, late September night in Washington, D.C., when I first remembered about the Conduit. The memory was, of course, triggered by the smell of a particularly scented set of roses that my fiancee had brought home from Trader Joe's.

The memory took me back to many years before. At night, I would lay down under the starched sheets and heavy comforters at my grandmother's old house. The heavy blankets would make me feel cocooned and protected. I would then close my eyes and, after a brief delay, see the Conduit. 

The Conduit was a silvery tunnel about twice as tall as I was, going straight off into the distance. There was no obvious source of light, but it was clear and well lit. At intervals, side tunnels would branch off at right angles. I could follow the branch a little bit and invariably come across a black wrought-iron gate. The black iron leaves and the black iron flowers of the gate were remarkably similar to my grandmother's set of East-German playing cards. But that won't become relevant until later. More importantly, I could peer through the gate, into a dreamscape. If I liked the dream, I would push open the gate and walk in, otherwise I'd trace my steps back to the conduit and look for another dream I liked better. 

Between the N cups of coffee, the incessant high-level alert at the start-up (yeah, I know, a start-up in D.C.) sleep had not been coming easily to me those days. 






(These were inspired from the Ace cards of my grandmother's old East German playing-card deck, a  1970 design by Walter Krauss called Braun-0136: I would later spend years searching for it, but more on that later)
